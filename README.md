This program finds the minimum and maximum values in an array A of size 7. It then checks if a given number n is within the range defined by the minimum and maximum values. If n is within the range, it finds the maximum number in array A that is less than n and prints it.

output:

min :5
max :65
Max number under 45 is : 40
